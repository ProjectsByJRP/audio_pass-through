# Audio Loopback excample

The repository contains 2 branches to run Audio Loopback for 2 different boards:
* **STM32F769I-DISCO** contains an example for STM32F769I-Discovery board which copies input buffer to output.
* **STM32H735G-DK** contains an example for STM32H735G-DK board which copies input buffer to output.

This software by the great work by https://community.st.com/people/Beaulier.Francois

wm8994.c is a modified version of the BSP variant
Input Mixer L and R zeroed and muted registers 0x29 and 0x2A  
Read the data sheet. I know its long and complicated. Do it anyway.  
Project configures Debug UART on the board, connect a terminal to get info regarding initialization status.  
Project relies on GPIO/SAI/Clock configuration code generated by STM32CubeMX.  

Line level input is expected, not speaker level so turn your volume down at least to 50% or lower.
